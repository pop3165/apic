cisco-iosxr v3.0 [March 4, 2014]
================================

This release is function wise equivalent to the previous release, which was 1.7.
The only difference is that this NED now is maintained using
a new product life-cycle which is independent of the NCS release life-cycle.

The version number 3.0 has been chosen to indicate a common baseline for
all NEDs, which is higher than any previous NED version.

Non-backwards compatible corrections:

  - This NED was formerly named "cisco-ios-xr". It has now been renamed to
    "cisco-iosxr" according to the new naming convention.
    When replacing older cisco-ios-xr NED with this version the old directory
    needs to be removed. Existing CDB data is not affected by this change.
