1. Introduction
---------------

   This document describes the NED for Cisco APIC 
   Application Policy Infrastructure Controller.

   NOTE: 
   This NED requires Java 1.7 to run with APIC 1.1, since APIC 1.1
   uses TLS version 1.2 which is only supported in Java 1.7 or later.

2. Getting started
------------------

   Set up the environment in $DIR, change DIR to something suitable

     > tar xvzf ned-cisco-apicdc.tgz
     > mv ned-cisco-apicdc $NCS_DIR/packages/neds/

     > export DIR=/tmp/ncs-cisco-apicdc
     > ncs-setup --ned-package $NCS_DIR/packages/neds/cisco-apicdc --dest $DIR
     > cd $DIR

   Start ncs:
     > ncs

   Start NCS CLI:
     > ncs_cli -C -u admin

   In the NCS CLI configure the device. Enter configuration mode:
     # configure

   Set the required configurables, address, remote user data including
   remote secondary password, if needed:
     # devices device apicdcdev address <device address>
     # devices device apicdcdev device-type generic ned-id cisco-apicdc-id
     # devices device apicdcdev state admin-state unlocked

     # devices authgroups group apicdc default-map remote-name <login username>
     # devices authgroups group apicdc default-map remote-password <login password>
     # devices device apicdcdev authgroup apicdc
     # commit


   Optional debug and trace configurables:

     Make the NED dump all APIC API sent to/from the Cisco APIC device
     # devices global-settings trace raw
     # commit

     Make the NED print debug log messages
     # java-vm java-logging logger com.tailf.packages.ned.ciscoApicdc level level-debug
     # commit

   Exit configure mode:
     # exit

   Try to connect to the device:
     # devices device apicdcdev connect

   Read the configuration from the device:
     # devices device apicdcdev sync-from

   Look at the configuration:
     # show running-config devices device apicdcdev

3. Known issues
---------------
    The check-sync function will report out-of-sync even for objects not modeled
    in the subtrees of fvTenant, vmmProvP and infraInfra.
