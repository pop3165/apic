cisco-ios v3.0 [March 4, 2014]
==============================

This release is function wise equivalent to the previous release, which was 1.8.
The only difference is that this NED now is maintained using
a new product life-cycle which is independent of the NCS release life-cycle.

The version number 3.0 has been chosen to indicate a common baseline for
all NEDs, which is higher than any previous NED version.

For this NED no upgrades are necessary.
